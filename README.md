## Usage
Users may use this application to input and save events throughout the workday. If the user navigates away from the page, the local storage will retain their inputs on the page. Clicking on any hour section will allow users to input text data. DayJS is used to track the present hour and display this information in the application. As the day progresses, each progressive hour will be highlighted as the present hour, while past and future hours will also be styled differently. At the top of the page, the current day is shown as well.
