# WORK DAY SCHEDULER

## Description

This application was built to organize events throughout the workday by the hour.
It provides a visual representation of the current hour vs future and past hours.
It allows users to navigate away from the page without losing their inputs.

## Usage

Users may use this application to input and save events throughout the workday. If the user navigates away from the page, the local storage will
retain their inputs on the page. Clicking on any hour section will allow users to input text data. As the day progresses, each progressive hour will be 
highlighted as the present hour, while past and future hours will also be styled differently. At the top of the page, the current day is shown as well.
